# Graph Optimal Transport framework for cross-domain alignment

## Summary
In this work, both Gromov-Wasserstein and Wasserstein distance are applied to improve the performance of different cross-domain alignment tasks, such as VQA, Machine Translation, etc

## Implemntation 
Note that the VQA model is developed upon [BAN model](https://github.com/jnhwkim/ban-vqa).

And the machine translation model is developed upon [texar](https://github.com/asyml/texar).
